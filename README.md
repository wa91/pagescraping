# pagescraping
Example script for collecting all locational information from a brands website.

The brands website usually has a 'Find a store' page, showing stores closest to the user. The infrastructure for this can be taken advantage of - by sending a list of lat/long coordinates covering the whole country (generated via python), all the stores and their attributes can be extracted.
